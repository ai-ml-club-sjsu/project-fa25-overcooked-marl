# AI/ML Club - Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning - Overcooked

**Academic Year:** 2025-2026 Fall Semester  
**Project Duration:** September 2025 - December 2025

## Project Description

The aim is to implement various reinforcement learning algorithms using increasingly more complex environments to gain insights and experiences on the unique problems that multi agent reinforcement learning offers. We are using the Berkeley overcooked environment first, as it was designed for AI, once all algorithms work, pivot and implement all in the actual game.

**Key Objectives:**
- Build unique working agents using PPO, RainbowDQN, and DuelingDQN within the Berkeley Overcooked environment
- Compare the performance both in training and outcomes of each algorithm
- Pivot codes to work in the actual Overcooked 2 game
