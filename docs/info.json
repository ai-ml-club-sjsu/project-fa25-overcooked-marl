  "project_name": "Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning - Google Football",
  "purpose": "Use Google Football (FIFA) as a tool of understanding Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning",
  "short_description": "Our project explores multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) through the Google Football FIFA environment. We aim to solve the challenge of coordinating multiple agents in dynamic, high-pressure environments where teamwork is essential. Using PPO as a baseline, and extending the work to similar and/or theoretical algorithms like PPG to understand why algorithms work better or worse in different environments.",
